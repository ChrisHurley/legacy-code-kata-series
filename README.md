# Legacy Code Kata Series

This series of katas is about refactoring a small piece of legacy code.

## Getting Started

Each kata starts from its own branch in the repository. The solution file in that branch has everything you need to get working on the kata straight away.

Each kata will ask you to perform a task which should take no more than an hour or two.
