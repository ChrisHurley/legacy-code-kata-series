# Legacy Code Kata Series

This Legacy Code kata series will help you practice maintaining and refactoring legacy code. Many developers work legacy code every day -- it is the code without tests that the whole team is afraid of changing. We will show you how to bring this codebase under control so that adding features takes minutes instead of days.

Our starting point is a codebase created by a no-nonsense contractor. The codebase manages the inventory for a small inn called Gilded Rose. It updates the quality of goods as they approach their sell by date. We are going to learn the best ways of extending this system without breaking it, and refactoring it to make further additions easier.

## Getting Started

Each kata will ask you to perform a task which should take no more than an hour or two.

Each kata starts from its own branch in the repository. The solution file in that branch has everything you need to get working on the kata straight away.

Get started with [Kata 1](Kata1.md)
