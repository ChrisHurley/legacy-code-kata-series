# Legacy Code Kata Series

This Legacy Code kata series will help you practice maintaining and refactoring legacy code. Many developers work with legacy code every day. This is often the most important code in the business, but can be notorious for lacking tests and being scary to change. We will practice techniques for bringing these code bases under control so that features can be more safely added and with less difficulty.

Our starting point is a codebase created by a no-nonsense contractor. The codebase manages the inventory for a small inn called Gilded Rose. The program automatically keeps track of the quality of goods as they approach their sell by date. We are going to try out ways of extending this system without breaking it, and perform refactorings to make further changes easier.

## Getting Started

Each kata will ask you to perform a task which should take no more than an hour or two.

Each kata starts from its own branch in the repository. The solution file in that branch has everything you need to get working on the kata straight away.

Get started with [Kata 1](Kata1.md)
