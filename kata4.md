#### Email

> Dear Developer,
>
> We need to add some items to our inventory as a result of a partnership with the local deli. Initially we will have to stock 10 new items, but if that goes well this may increase to 100. Can our system handle it? I have attached a data dump of the items the deli will send over. The changes need to be done by the end of the week.
